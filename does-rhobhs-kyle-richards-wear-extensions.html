Does Richards wear hair extensions?</p><p><strong>Kyle Richards has used hair extensions, such as Hidden Crown’s “Halo” system. These extensions are temporary, held in place by the weight of the wearer’s hair, allowing for different looks without committing to growing or cutting their hair. Richards has had a long career onscreen, dating back to appearing on “Little House on the Prairie” as a five-year-old and “Halloween” when she was nine.</strong></p><p>For more on Kyle Richards’ screen career and her hair, read on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hair</h2><p>Longtime viewers of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” will have noticed major changes in Kyle Richards’ hair throughout her decade on the show.</p><p>In 2018, she seemingly got into a chopping mood, <a href=# rel=noopener>cutting off much of her usually long brunette locks until they were barely past her shoulder</a>.</p><p>By the following season, however, <a href=# rel=noopener>Richards’ hair appeared to have regained its original length, as well as adding some bold new bangs</a>, prompting some to question whether or not she uses extensions.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to Hidden Crown, Richards has used their extension system, called the “Halo”</a>, a temporary solution made of real human hair. They claim the system takes less than a minute to put on and is held in place purely with the weight of the wearer’s own hair, allowing Richards to have a stylish faux lob without needing to make any permanent changes to her hair.</p><p>In 2020, while self-quarantined during the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href=# rel=noopener>Richards also revealed that she has her hair colored</a>. She shared that her father was completely grey by the time he was 40 and that she began going grey at 25.</p><p>Performing her own hair care during the lockdown, <a href=# rel=noopener>she used Clairol Root Touch-Up Hair Color Creme, costing about $13</a>, a small price to keep her luscious hair looking its best.</p><p>Richards believes in keeping things simple when it comes to hair care, saying that <a href=# rel=noopener>she doesn’t like to put products in her hair because it “dulls the shine”</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Career</h2><p>Though she has spent more than a decade on RHOBH since joining the show’s cast in 2010, Kyle Richards’ screen career stretches back many years. <a href=# rel=noopener>Her first role came in 1974 when she was just five years old, appearing in 18 episodes of “Little House on the Prairie”</a>.</p><p>She continued appearing in TV roles throughout the 1970s before being cast in her biggest role in 1978, <a href=# rel=noopener>portraying Lindsey Wallace in “Halloween”</a>. Lindsey is the young girl being looked after by Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis.</p><p>In 2019, it was announced that <a href=# rel=noopener>Richards would be returning to the role for the first time in more than 40 years</a>, portraying an adult Lindsey in “Halloween Kills”. She appeared in another horror two years after “Halloween”, with a role in “The Watcher in the Woods”.</p><p>In adulthood, Richards had less of a screen presence. Outside of appearing in 21 episodes of “ER”, she was mostly restricted to guest appearances.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Real Housewives</h2><p>In 2010, Bravo launched “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills”, the sixth iteration of the “Real Housewives” franchise. <a href=# rel=noopener>Richards was a founding member of the reality show’s cast and has gone on to appear in more than 200 episodes</a>.</p><p>Richards appears in the show alongside <a href=# rel=noopener>her second husband, Mauricio Umansky, a Los Angeles real estate agent of Russian and Greek Jewish descent</a>. She converted to Modern Orthodox Judaism when she married Umansky.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Kyle and Mauricio have three children together: Alexia, Sophie, and Portia</a>. Kyle also has another daughter from her first marriage to Guraish Aldjufrie, Farrah, who also appears on RHOBH.</p><p>Richards and other members of the RHOBH cast <a href=# rel=noopener>appeared in the music video for Lady Gaga’s 2014 song “G.U.Y.” from her album “ARTPOP”</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jp2mnqtdp7WwrsesZKSxnJp6s7XCoZirnKNixKat0WacsayVo8Cqu82sZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdoes-rhobhs-kyle-richards-wear-extensions.html&text=Does%20RHOBHs%20Kyle%20Richards%20Wear%20Extensions%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-rhobhs-kyle-richards-wear-extensions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-rhobhs-kyle-richards-wear-extensions.html&title=Does%20RHOBHs%20Kyle%20Richards%20Wear%20Extensions%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdoes-rhobhs-kyle-richards-wear-extensions.html&title=Does%20RHOBHs%20Kyle%20Richards%20Wear%20Extensions%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-rhobhs-kyle-richards-wear-extensions.html&title=Does%20RHOBHs%20Kyle%20Richards%20Wear%20Extensions%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-rhobhs-kyle-richards-wear-extensions.html&description=Does%20RHOBHs%20Kyle%20Richards%20Wear%20Extensions%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./score-a-on-say-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Score A+ on say">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alexa-marie-aikman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Alexa Marie Aikman?
