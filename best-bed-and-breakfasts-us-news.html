The fact is these lodgings offer a host of amenities that many traditional hotels do not, such as snacks, the chance to mingle with your host and the other guests at happy hour, house-made breakfasts, and of course, adorable accommodations all included in the cost.</p><p>Sure, staying in an old house may seem like something straight out of a Halloween movie, but these B&Bs aren't <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=# data-follow=true>haunted with ghouls and ghosts</a> of former owners. These beautiful homes have been transformed into luxury accommodations where couples, families, and friends can gather for a vacation that's equal parts relaxing and exciting.</p><p>If you're looking for a cozy place to call home for a few days while exploring a new destination or going to an old favorite vacation spot, keep reading for our list of travel expert-recommended B&Bs around the country.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>10 Small Towns in the U.S. That Feel Like Stepping Back in Time</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/shutterstock_1574434555.jpg><p>Less than a mile from downtown Asheville is <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Abbington Green</a>, a AAA Four Diamond Select Registry Property. The historic home was completed in 1908 by the same supervising architect that worked on the Biltmore Estate, George Vanderbilt's Gilded Age mansion.</p><p>"There is a main and carriage house with seven rooms, a two-bedroom suite, a spa room, a dining room, and a living room with games, a piano, and a guitar," says hotel expert for <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>Insider Picks</a>, <strong>Jennifer Agress</strong>. "Unique for historic homes, there are only king beds, towel warmers, fireplaces, luxury bathtubs with a view of the TV in every room."</p><p>Adults traveling together will love that there's a daily social hour with free wine and beer, along with a delicious breakfast. When it's time to get out and explore, the B&B is close to downtown Asheville, The Biltmore, and the Blue Ridge Parkway.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/shutterstock_1624670563.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Chapel Valley Estate</a> is a stunning bed and breakfast that started out as a renovation project in 2003. The large inn has three bedrooms and two suites, including a beautiful cottage loft with a full kitchen.</p><p>"I've stayed at a variety of guest houses and Airbnbs, but this one has retained the original charm and still runs like a traditional B&B. Their remodel of the old farmhouse is impeccable down to every last detail," says <strong>Meg St-Esprit</strong>, a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Pittsburgh-based journalist</a>.</p><p>Those staying in the cottage loft or the carriage house suite can have breakfast delivered right to their room, which is nice for couples looking to have a little more time alone. Speaking of breakfast, the signature dish is ratatouille, and it always ends with dessert.</p><p>Another perk is that the bed and breakfast is not far from a range of outdoor activities. "It's very close to Volant, which is an Amish community with tons of tourist attractions, shops, and eateries. McConnell Mill State Park has some of the most gorgeous kayaking, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>hiking, and climbing</a> in the state," says St-Esprit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/shutterstock_1974664904.jpg><p>With just four guest rooms and suites, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Sandes of Time Bed and Breakfast</a> in Portland is a sought-after bed and breakfast where country life is just a short drive away from the city. The 1907 home has a large porch where you can take in the view while sipping on your morning coffee or lemonade in the afternoon.</p><p>"This bed and breakfast oozes with quaint, old-fashioned charm as it sits perched on a knoll. The proprietors are just as warm and friendlyâ€¦the location is ideal for visiting Portland, Lake Oswego, Oregon City, Canby, Wilsonville, and Aurora," says <strong>Cori Solomon</strong>, a wine and travel writer at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Written Palette</a>.</p><p>"One can enjoy a relaxing stay in a picturesque setting yet be close to attractions within a 30-mile radius," says Solomon. Within driving distance is Lake Oswego, which is known for its Museum without Walls, and downtown Portland.</p><p>In the morning guests can enjoy a two-course breakfast where the menu changes each morning. And after a day of exploring the area, grab a blanket from your room and enjoy a movie at the in-house movie theater where popcorn and drinks are always on the house.</p><p><strong>For more travel advice delivered straight to your inbox,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/shutterstock_417977779.jpg><p>Those looking for a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=# data-follow=true>wine country getaway</a> will want to book a room at the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>For Friends Inn</a>. The charming bed and breakfast has the perfect combination of modern amenities with old-world charm, and its location can't be beat. "It's an ideal location for a Santa Barbara County wine country visit with 100 plus wineries in the area," says Solomon. In fact, most of the wineries are within an easy 30-minute drive.</p><p>While the main house is beautiful, six tiny houses offer a private home, porch, and parking. Near the back of the property is the Sunstone Tower, which is a two-story suite with two bedrooms. No matter what type of room you book, guests are privy to a "Friendship Pass" where they can get complimentary and two-for-one tastings at nearby wineries and complimentary desserts at local restaurants.</p><p>Before setting out for the day, enjoy a three-course breakfast and coffee. Along with the wineries, there are plenty of other activities for guests to do including visiting Solvang, which is known for its Danish vibe, and adorable shopping. Then return to For Friends Inn for its evening social wine and hors d'oeuvres happy hour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/shutterstock_396421396.jpg><p>Nestled along the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=# data-follow=true>historic streets</a> and buildings of the nation's oldest city is <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>The Collector Luxury Inn & Gardens</a>. With a minimum age of 16 to stay, the inn has a distinctly adult feel and leans into that with fire pits and an onsite bar.</p><p>"The Inn itself consists of nine historic buildings, some of which date back to 1790. The property is a gorgeous, luxurious respite in the heart of America's oldest city, St. Augustine. So you are completely wrapped in history," says <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>travel journalist</a> <strong>Betsi Hill</strong>. Among the historic buildings is The Well, the onsite bar, which was St. Augustine's first two car garage. Now, the locale is serving hand-crafted cocktails to those staying at the Inn.</p><p>With so much to do nearby, there's no way you can do it all in just one weekend. According to Hill, highlights in the city include the Lightner Museum, the Castillo de San Marcos, and the Colonial Quarter. If you're looking to stay in for an afternoon, the Inn offers historical tours of the property three times a week and has a heated pool and lawn games for some fun in the sun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/shutterstock_2003862905.jpg><p>Another great B&B for those going wine tasting in Virginia is <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Stone Manor Boutique Inn</a>. This all-suite inn dates back to 1908, and each suite features a private bathroom, luxury amenities, and has a different theme.</p><p>"There's a large room that's converted into a grand dining area and a long communal table that almost feels somewhat Games of Thrones-y," says <strong>Ruksana Hussain</strong>, a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>travel and lifestyle journalist</a>. "They also have a lovely outdoor space where you can hang out with a book or chat with other guests. And the best part is this is a south Asian-owned venue, which is rare to find in the industry."</p><p>Each morning breakfast is served in the grand dining room, where a large communal table is set for guests. Behind the table is a large coffee and tea bar where you can make your own drinks while waiting for your meal.</p><p>When evening draws near, step into the bar to grab a beer or glass of wine before going out to the game room or one of the parlors to enjoy reading a book or playing a card game with friends before going out for dinner in nearby Loudoun County, which is known for its wineries and delightful restaurants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/shutterstock_1715966080.jpg><p>While you may not think of Wisconsin as a destination for bed and breakfasts, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Thorp House Inn and Cottages</a> will change your mind. "It's in a beautiful location (year-round) and offers classic B&B charm with vintage flair and homey atmosphere. Plus, the breakfasts served daily were varied and delicious," says <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>travel writer</a> <strong>Katy Spratte Joyce</strong>.</p><p>The family-friendly bed and breakfast has six standard rooms and six stand-alone cottages, so you'll be able to find a room that can best fit your needs. Just note that the only guests who get breakfast included are those who stay in the inn rooms and not the cottages.</p><p>"Thorp House is conveniently located in the mid-peninsula area of Door County, so the entire area is easily accessible," says Joyce. "Specifically, the inn is near Peninsula State Park which offers great hiking, a lighthouse, and a new observation tower hundreds of feet up on Eagle Bluff. Water recreation opportunities, winery tours, and a lavender farm are other nearby attractions."<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The 10 Prettiest Small Towns in the U.S.</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/shutterstock_680336164.jpg><p>Just minutes <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>from the beach</a> and perfectly situated in the historical district of Grandview Heights is <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Casa Grandview</a>. The beachy bed and breakfast has recently been completely refurbished and restored into a place where guests can relax after a day of exploring. "It is located in a historic but hip part of Palm Beach County and the owners have made it a must-visit destination. Truly a hidden gem and a best-kept secret," says <strong>Annie Davis,</strong> founder of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Palm Beach Travel</a>.</p><p>The bed and breakfast allows guests to have breakfast on their private veranda before going out sightseeing. Guest rooms are well appointed with a beach theme that fits the area. When it's time to cool off, guests can enjoy the onsite pool. "There are even villas with private pools," says Davis.</p><p>With the beach close by, there are plenty of water activities to take part in, and those who love shopping will find the Antique Row district a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>great spot for finding treasures</a>. If you enjoy staying out late will love knowing that the area is filled with nightlife, and when you're done at the club, the bed and breakfast is just a short Uber ride away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/shutterstock_1139949338.jpg><p>History is all around at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>The Kenmore Inn</a>, a 1793 home turned inn in 1932, making it Fredericksburg's longest operating inn. The nine spacious rooms each have a different theme and custom designed furniture that will take you back in time. The beautiful gardens are a nice place to take a stroll or just enjoy the fragrance of blooming flowers.</p><p>Down the stairs from the bedrooms is the kitchen and dining room, which are the life of the Inn. Here, guests can enjoy a hot cup of coffee and breakfast. The manager and owner of the inn can often be seen talking to guests about what they plan to do for the day, and giving tips about the best things to see in the city, including Mary Washington's House or the Rising Sun Tavern.</p><p>When night falls, be sure to step outside to the front porch, where porch swings are just waiting for you to sit down and enjoy the crisp evening air. In the fall, take a blanket out with you, and in summer watch fireflies light up the nearby bushes as street lights flicker on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/shutterstock_759832939.jpg><p>One of the most alluring bed and breakfasts in the country is the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Wang Shi China Palace</a> in Oklahoma. It was once the owner's actual home and has 26 units that are all pet-friendly and have a private bathrooms. The inner pool is a focal point of the locale, with red Chinese lanterns hanging overhead.</p><p>"I love the incorporation of Chinese culture and art that Victoria (the owner) has brought with her," says <strong>Heide Brandes</strong>, an Oklahoma City-based <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>travel journalist</a>. The design is open and so full of natural light, which I also love. Besides the central indoor swimming pool, the WangShi China Palace is also surrounded by Oklahoma's natural landscape, so you can stroll through the trees and hills and watch the sunsets that this state is so famous for."</p><p>The bed and breakfast is known for its elevated serviceâ€”it even has a free limousine service that will pick guests up from the airport and take them to area attractions. Each guest is also greeted with complimentary wine, champagne, tea, or coffee when they check-in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmm52jqXqjscNmmKecXZe%2Fpq3Kn5isrKNiwrR5zZ6urGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-bed-and-breakfasts-us-news.html&text=Best%20Bed%20and%20Breakfasts%20in%20the%20U.S.%20%20Best%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-bed-and-breakfasts-us-news.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-bed-and-breakfasts-us-news.html&title=Best%20Bed%20and%20Breakfasts%20in%20the%20U.S.%20%20Best%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-bed-and-breakfasts-us-news.html&title=Best%20Bed%20and%20Breakfasts%20in%20the%20U.S.%20%20Best%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-bed-and-breakfasts-us-news.html&title=Best%20Bed%20and%20Breakfasts%20in%20the%20U.S.%20%20Best%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-bed-and-breakfasts-us-news.html&description=Best%20Bed%20and%20Breakfasts%20in%20the%20U.S.%20%20Best%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./44639-kabza-de-small-age-family-songs-albums-profiles-instagram-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kabza de Smalls bio: age, family, songs, albums, net worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./de-la-amiga-de-emiliano.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Video De la amiga de emiliano Discord">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
