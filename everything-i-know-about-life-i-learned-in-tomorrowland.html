His imagination was bigger than all of the Disney parks combined and he was a huge proponent of progress (hence the Carousel of Progress!). Nothing was too big or difficult to conceptualize – if it was in his mind, he attempted to bring it to life! But in my humble opinion, Tomorrowland is so much more than a glimpse into the future or what </span><i><span>could </span></i><span>be. Sure, there are gadgets and gizmos aplenty (oh wait, wrong land!) but the real gems of this land are the everyday life lessons I observe when I walk across that bridge from Cinderella Castle into the World of Tomorrow!</span></p><p><span>There is much debate in the Disney community as to whether or not the new Tomorrowland sign is genius or minimalist. My opinion? It’s both! It’s sleek new age look is just what Walt would have had in mind-innovative progress! In a land full of Space Rangers, Aliens and nitro-infused cold brew (we will get to that in a moment!) a less embellished welcome into this beloved land is just what the doctor (or in this case, Imagineers) ordered.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>My name is Britta and I’m a scaredy-cat. Before my Disney obsession (I call those the dark days…) I wouldn’t go on anything faster than a slow crawl. Lateral or horizontal, round and round…it didn’t matter, it didn’t happen. But when I discovered the smooth, controlled drops of Big Thunder Mountain and Seven Dwarves Mine Train, I stopped living in fear of coasters and just started living. Having said that, Space Mountain still gives me the tummy in the shoes feeling, every time. I attribute most of this to the fact that the ride is basically completely in the dark (the ‘overlay’ during MNSSHP is completely in the dark!). So, why do I continue to subject myself to near fear paralysis every time I’m in the Magic Kingdom? Because despite my fright, (or maybe </span><i><span>in</span></i><span> spite of it) it really is fun to face your past, dropping 26 feet in the dark.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;There are two types of people- the kind that sits on the people mover, and the kind that stretch out (yours truly is the latter). Plus, there is absolutely nothing more therapeutic for both the mind </span><i><span>and </span></i><span>body after hours of walking around the most magical place on Earth! It can even help you restore your sense of magic in the off chance that double strollers and frustrated park goers have tainted your faith in humanity. Not to mention it has the best view of Cinderella Castle in the entire park, free of charge! The only thing that would make this attraction better would be if they allowed beverages so you could sip your Joffrey’s whilst people watching and wondering for the umpteenth time if you accidentally got on Space Mountain (please tell me I’m not the only one who does this?)</span></p><p><span>As you have probably already noted, all of the Joffrey’s kiosks are themed differently in each of the four Disney parks. Some are just plain kiosks while others are more conceptual. Take Joffrey’s Revive in Tomorrowland, for example. It literally looks like a spaceship! But the supernaturalist aesthetic isn’t the only thing about this unique java stop that is out of this world; the Mission to S’mores espresso beverage has been exclusively on the Revive menu and the nitro cold brew, before it’s extreme popularity, was also a Revive special. Aside from all of that, as much as I love to walk into the Magic Kingdom with a Joffrey’s in hand, Revive has a little something special that the Ferryboat kiosk or even that ‘other’ coffee shop just doesn’t quite have. Perhaps it’s the view as you look into the future as Walt saw it and realize just how small, yet intricate our individual role is in this thing we call progress.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Um yeah, sure it is…haha! We all have that person we Disney with who is the most reasonable, sane human being on the planet until they procure a FastPass for Buzz Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin. While Toy Story Mania has the jovial cadence of carnival games, Buzz Lightyear gives you a laser and asks you to protect the galaxy from suspicious forces, and to be better at it than the person beside you that most likely shares your bank or at least Netflix account information! You may walk through the queue holding hands, but you’ll walk off the attraction with crossed arms starting every sentence with ‘I just think it’s funny how…’ I jest, but in all honesty, if you’re the other half of the friendship/relationship/marriage who has mad button mashing skills…give it a rest, winning has to grow old at some point, right?</span></p><p><span>Tomorrowland is truly a spot for all legs of your journey in the Magic Kingdom. Looking for adventure? Stop by Space Mountain or Buzz Lightyear! Need a pick me up? Revive is tucked up next to the Tomorrowland stage! Need to rest those tootsies while taking in the next best thing to an ocean breeze and breathtaking views? Hop on the Peoplemover! When we think Walt Disney World, we may think of Cinderella Castle and princess meet and greets, but when I think of Walter Elias Disney, I think of Tomorrowland: a land sprinkled with magic, unforgettable life lessons and a little of the impossible.</span></p><h3><strong>Enjoy the magic of Disney all year ’round with Celebrations Magazine!</strong></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrationspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Issue-66Ver-140x300.png alt width=140 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h4>1 year/$29.99!</h4><h3><a href=#><strong>Click here to order!</strong></a></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77AraCopqOlv6a%2F0meaqKVfZ31yhY5qaGhoZGSyt7HRsquhoZ6ceqp5yqemsGWRl7y2wIyloJ%2BdXZ56rbHAq6WenF2eu27Azqamq6qfrLmiusNo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feverything-i-know-about-life-i-learned-in-tomorrowland.html&text=Everything%20I%20Know%20About%20Life%20I%20Learned%20in%20Tomorrowland&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feverything-i-know-about-life-i-learned-in-tomorrowland.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feverything-i-know-about-life-i-learned-in-tomorrowland.html&title=Everything%20I%20Know%20About%20Life%20I%20Learned%20in%20Tomorrowland" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feverything-i-know-about-life-i-learned-in-tomorrowland.html&title=Everything%20I%20Know%20About%20Life%20I%20Learned%20in%20Tomorrowland" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feverything-i-know-about-life-i-learned-in-tomorrowland.html&title=Everything%20I%20Know%20About%20Life%20I%20Learned%20in%20Tomorrowland" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feverything-i-know-about-life-i-learned-in-tomorrowland.html&description=Everything%20I%20Know%20About%20Life%20I%20Learned%20in%20Tomorrowland" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./aj-mccarron-wife-katherine-webb-mccarron.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=" AJ McCarrons wife Katherine Webb-McCarron ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./shape-of-a-speed-skating-rink-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shape of a speed skating rink">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
