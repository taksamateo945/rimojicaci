The actress celebrated her 40th birthday in a grand style in November 2022. A few days before her birthday, she <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">received</a> a Volkswagen Taigo car worth R449,000.</p><p>Having bagged a brand ambassadorial gig with Benoni Citi VW that month, Thembisa was gifted the luxury car as part of her endorsement deal. She found it hard to contain her joy and then took to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to announce that she had joined the Benoni Citi VW family and was grateful for the early birthday gift received from the brand.</p><h2><b>Her Parents’ Names are Pat and Yolisa Mdoda</b></h2><p>The name of Thembisa Mdoda’s mother is Yolisa while her father’s name is Pat. Sadly, in the year 2009, Thembisa Mdoda’s mother, Yolisa Mdoda passed away from pancreatic cancer and her death broke down the family.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Speaking to Drum</a> in 2020 about the loss of her mother to cancer, the House of Zwide actress stated that she wasn’t quite close to her mum while alive. Nonetheless, her death hit her so hard that she felt pains all over her body when her father broke the news of her passing to her.</p><p>Afterward, she <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">regretted</a> not spending enough time with her mum as she was busy growing her career in entertainment. Despite regretting not being close to her mother, the acclaimed TV presenter was grateful that her late mum shaped her values which greatly influenced her to become the woman she is today.</p><p>She said her mother taught her how to love and take care of the people close to her, putting them first. The late Yolisa Mdoda worked as a publicist at Transnet and an SABC1 continuity presenter. On the other hand, Thembisa’s father, Patillizwe ‘Pat’ Mdoda is still alive. He is a businessman and a philanthropist who recently erected a school in a village in Eastern Cape.</p><h2><b>She has Three Sisters including Anele, an Award-Winning Media Personality</b></h2><p>Thembisa Mdoda is the second child of her parents four children who are all girls. Her older sister’s name is Unathi Mdoda, whereas her younger siblings are <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Anele</a> and Zama Mdoda. Zama Mdoda studied Politics, Philosophy, and Economics at a New York-based university. She currently lives in New York.</p><p>With their mother, a former media personality, it’s no surprise that Anele and Thembisa Mdoda-Nxumalo followed in her footsteps and have grown to be ranked among the most popular media figures in Mzansi. Thembisa Mdoda is almost two years older than her sister, Anele Mdoda who was born on May 19th, 1984.</p><p>Anele acquired a degree in Politics and International Relations at the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>University of Pretoria</a>. She began her career as a radio DJ when she was 20 years old and after she graduated from the university, she joined Highveld FM. She subsequently worked for 5FM after leaving Highveld FM. Then from 2009 to 2010, she co-hosted SA’s Got Talent alongside Rob van Vuuren.</p><p>More so, Anele Mdoda served as a judge in the reality competition, Clash of the Choirs, and equally, Miss South Africa in 2012. She then moved on to host the Miss South Africa beauty pageant in 2021 and 2022. Over the years, she has hosted several shows including Real Talk with Anele, 947 Breakfast Club Show, Voice South Africa, and The Buzz.</p><p><strong>Thus far in her blossoming career, Thembisa Mdoda’s sister has bagged the following awards:</strong></p><ul><li>Rising Star of the Year Award by Media Magazine, 2012</li><li>Nickelodeon’s Kids Choice Award for Top South African DJ</li><li>SAFTA Golden Horn Award for Best Talk Show, 2017</li><li>Best of Joburg Award for Best Radio Personality, 2020</li><li>South African Radio Award for Best Breakfast Show Host, 2021</li><li>Best of Joburg Award for Best Radio Personality of the Year, 2021</li></ul><h2><strong>Thembisa Mdoda attended Wits University and the University of Cape Town</strong></h2><p>Thembisa Mdoda holds three university degrees. She first obtained a degree in Drama and Journalism from <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Wits University</a>. With the determination to become an all-around entertainer, she proceeded with her post-graduate studies at the same university and earned Honours in Dramatic Arts in 2008.</p><p>Mdoda additionally bagged a degree in Graphic Design from the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>University of Cape Town</a>. Little wonder, she has emerged as one of the most sought-after presenters in South Africa.</p><h2><strong>She Began her Career as a Radio On-Air Personality</strong></h2><p>Thembisa Mdoda started her career in radio and has climbed to the top, thanks to her sheer dedication and talent. Also, her ability to speak many South African languages paved a way for her to achieve an upward career trajectory. The Eastern Cape native fluently speaks <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Xhosa</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Pedi</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Tswana</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Zulu</a>, and English.</p><p>Thembisa had her first radio gig while in the university as she worked as a newsreader for Voice of Wits.

She further had a brief stint at Yebo Radio and hosted Touch HD Let’s Do Lunch. Besides radio presenting, Mdoda has served as the MC for corporate events, product launches, as well as award shows.</p><h2><strong>She Got her Breakthrough as the Host of the Reality TV Series, Our Perfect Wedding&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In the year 2015, Mdoda was <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">announced</a> as the new presenter of the reality show, Our Perfect Wedding. Every season, a new presenter gets introduced to the show, and the Mthatha-born was deemed a perfect fit for the job that year. Serving as a replacement for <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Tumi Morake</a>, who’s one of the show’s best presenters, was a huge task for Thembisa Mdoda.</p><p>However, she moved on to nail her role in the show and her signature signing-off catchphrase, “Sifike! Sabona! Satshatisa!” made her a TV darling. Thembisa was mesmerizing to watch and interestingly, her role in Our Perfect Wedding won her some accolades as she emerged as one of SA’s best presenters.</p><p>While on the show, the media personality was dubbed a national treasure by viewers. She proved that she was not only working for fun but to make a positive impact in the lives of people when she went the extra mile to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">give</a> a bride a perfect wedding. After a series of disappointments that made Mr. and Mrs. Khanyile’s big day impossible to happen, Thembisa beckoned on her crew to assist her to get things moving.</p><p>Seeing the bride in tears got her shattered and she had to step up her role than just working as a presenter. And with that benevolence act, Mdoda completely captured the heart of Mzansi. Despite hitting a career-high with her work on OPW, Thembisa Mdoda decided it was time for her to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">move on</a> from the show and build her acting career in 2017.</p><p>She left Our Perfect Wedding, having had a tight schedule on the show which made it difficult for her to progress in her career. Though many said she was doomed to fail, Thembisa’s star has kept on shining brighter on global stages ever since.</p><h2><strong>Thembisa Mdoda Has Since Hosted Many of SA’s Popular Shows</strong></h2><p>Even though she left Our Perfect Wedding to focus on acting, Thembisa Mdoda couldn’t resist the urge to return to the small screen as a show host. In 2018, she worked as the host of the DStv Mzansi Viewers’ Choice Awards Red Carpet and the co-host of the SABC1 show, Your Next Million. In the following year, she was the host of Madiba: The Do Up on Mzansi Magic.</p><p>Furthermore, in that same 2019, she hosted the first season of the Mzansi Magic’s show, Not A Diva. Also, she served as the host for the red carpet of the AFI Fashion Week. In June 2019, the award-winning presenter was <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">announced</a> as the host of the wedding show, 2 Families and a Wedding Dress.</p><p>The reality wedding show saw BET Africa partnering up with Veil Bridal Couture – an exclusive Pronovias retailer to give 13 lucky brides the chance to pick the wedding dress of their dreams. Later on, Thembisa Mdoda-Nxumalo <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">had</a> one of her career highlights when she was made the<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> co-host</a> of a pan-African singing competition, Old Mutual Amazing Voices.</p><p>She joined the show in the second season and became quite famous across the continent as Old Mutual Amazing Voices aired on eight African channels across the African continent. Still pushing her way to the top, the 41 years old <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">landed</a> another big hosting gig in June 2022.</p><p>On Mzansi Wethu, she debuted as the host of Suxoka, which means ‘don’t lie’ in isiXhosa, the next month. As the presenter of the confrontational show, Thembisa Mdoda tackled human stories, trying to get to the truth. More so, in February 2023, the eminent TV personality was unveiled as the host of Mzansi Wethu’s latest news broadcast, Newz Room Afrika.</p><h2><strong>Mdoda Kicked Off Her Acting Career in the late 2000s</strong></h2><p>While still pursuing her interest in TV presenting, Thembisa Mdoda put to a start her acting career. She began in theatre and thus, has many theatre credits in her alluring profile. In 2010, she was part of the cast for the theatrical production of Crocodile Tears. In the next year, she featured in Brer Rabbit and then landed a role in the play, Vagina Monologues in 2013.</p><p>She further played a role in The Children’s Monologues directed by James Ngcobo in the year 2017.

As a result, she switched management agencies, joining Owen S. Management. Since then, she has been attaining incredible milestones in her acting career. One of the milestones is her <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">joining</a> the cast of the popular SA TV series, The Queen in March 2021.</p><p>Due to the injury sustained on set by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Zandile Msutwana</a>, who plays Vuyiswa Maake in the soapie, Thembisa took up the role temporarily till Zandile was fit to return to her role. She made her debut in The Queen in April 2021 and with support and guidance from Zandile Msutwana, she was able to steal the hearts of the viewers with her stellar performances.</p><p>Thembisa further gained dominance in the acting scene in the following year as she bagged a main role in the e.tv hit drama series, House of Zwide.
