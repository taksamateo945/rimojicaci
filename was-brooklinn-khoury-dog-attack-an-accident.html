She is also known as a Threadhead, which represents Threat Wallets.</p><p>Aside from being an entrepreneur and an Instagram sensation, she is also an influencer and has collaborated with various brands, including Rastaclat and Millennium Boards.</p><h2>Was Brooklinn Khoury Dog Attack An Accident? Injury</h2><p>Model Khoury was attacked by her cousin’s pit bull in 2020, which resulted in her losing her upper lips.</p><p>According to her in an interview with the People, he literally jumped from his sitting position onto my face. I was standing, and he was sitting- he literally sprung up. And he was literally hanging- literally like arms, legs hanging off my lip. I thought, “Oh my gosh, get on the ground with him, hold his head, follow him wherever he goes,”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/315653084_811066056625855_4491444825053017538_n.jpg><p>According to her, she finds it upsetting to look at the disturbing photos from her attack that she made public via her Instagram account.</p><p>In her post, she wrote, “I don’t expect anyone to understand because how could you? I can’t describe how I feel when I look in the mirror. It’s as if I’m a stranger, embodied in someone I’ve known.”</p><p>According to all the information she has shared about the attack, the dog mistook her for a threat and attacked her, so we can conclude that it was an accident.</p><p><strong>See Also | <span><a href=#>Is American Singer Chloe Bailey Pregnant?

The specialist took the skin and nerves from her arm to create a fully functional new lip.</p><p>She stated, ” If you were to tell me a year ago I’d have the smile I have today, I wouldn’t believe you. I lost so much hope waiting a whole year to find the surgeon I have today. It’s been such a hard yet beautiful process. I am so thankful for everyone in my life. This is just a reminder to trust the process. Timing is everything.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/326397636_1523450458060420_2564587579518436613_n.jpg><p>Furthermore, the post that the Instagram star has been sharing shows that she is having a great improvement in her surgery and she is loving her new lip.</p><p>According to a post she shared during her doctor’s visit shows that her face is now completely healed plus she has announced that she was feeling really good after her surgery. Finally, it can be seen that the model has regained her confidence, which she thought she had lost after the incident.</p><h2>Brooklinn Khoury Shares Before-and-After Photos of Her</h2><p>In a TikTok video posted Tuesday, the 23-year-old pro skateboarder and model asked if she’s able to “smile as bright” as she did before she lost part of her nose and upper lip in a dog attack in 2020.</p><p>Since my lip is still so long, I feel comfortable smiling without showing my teeth now,” she explained in the clip. “Before, I had a lot of teeth showing and now I feel comfortable without it.”</p><p>After revealing the before-and-after photos, Khoury said she hopes to regain her original smile as her recovery progresses.</p><p>I definitely think after this next surgery, I’ll be showing off my teeth a lot more,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tUD6T7bSA_bnsN4Kw3vWfP915MI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(974x369:976x371):format(webp)/Brooklinn-Khoury-010623-2-8a48d0351a2449d180566c38a0035ea3.jpg"><p>In her social media posts, Khoury has been candid about her recovery process.</p><p>Recently, she shared photos of her progress on Instagram, recalling how scared she initially felt about her injuries and reflecting on perseverance.</p><p>Reflecting on my journey since the incident, I can’t begin to express how it feels looking at photos and videos. They’ve really helped me realise just how precious life is, and that timing is truly unpredictable yet divine. It was never in my plans for something like this to happen, but I have gained so much insight into finding bliss during each step of this odyssey. Whatever you’re facing now, things will improve in their own time.</p><p>“At first it was hard for me to see what the future held for me,” Khoury wrote in another post. “Thank God for giving me the strength, and for the people in my life who help me grow and continue to trust the process.”</p><p>Her followers raved in the comments that she’s looking more and more like herself since she went to Sephora last week where a makeup artist drew an upper lip on her face.</p><h2>Hw Is Old Brooklinn Khoury?
