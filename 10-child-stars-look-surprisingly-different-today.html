Throughout the years, it’s been interesting to see child stars transform, and some of them have changed so much that they no longer look like the same little stars&nbsp;who once appeared on-screen. &nbsp;Here are 10 child stars who look surprisingly different today.</p><p><strong>Abigail Breslin</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CAySpu3UkAAMj07.jpg alt=CAySpu3UkAAMj07 width=641 height=641 sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Abigail Breslin has been in the industry since she was just three years old. During her childhood, she appeared in several popular films including Signs and Little Miss Sunshine.&nbsp;However, unlike some people who look the same throughout their entire lives, Breslin’s look started to change during her teenage years. &nbsp;As she blossomed into a young woman, many people could not believe that she was the same little quirky kid. Now 19 years-old, Breslin&nbsp;is still working and continuing to add on to her already impressive resume.</p><p>(image via&nbsp;https://twitter.com/imablinker)</p><p><strong>Haley Joel Osment</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CGfSbJzU8AAbaDs.jpg alt=CGfSbJzU8AAbaDs width=640 height=380 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>If the phrase, “I see dead people,” means anything to you, then you know exactly who Haley Joel Osment is. &nbsp;Best-known for his role in the film The Sixth Sense,&nbsp;Osment was one of the most popular young stars until he disappeared from the spotlight. &nbsp;However, even if he were to return now, there’s a pretty good chance that many people wouldn’t even recognize him. &nbsp;As an adult, he looks almost completely different from he did as a child.</p><p>(image via&nbsp;https://twitter.com/Daily_Express)</p><p><strong>Danny Bonaduce</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BiyquprCEAAhYyE.jpg alt=BiyquprCEAAhYyE width=640 height=469 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Best-known for his role as Danny Partridge on the popular 70s show, The Partridge Family, Danny Bonaduce has decided to work outside of acting as an adult. &nbsp;In recent years, he’s written a book, and boxed and wrestled competitively. &nbsp; Since 2011, he has also worked as a radio talk show host in Seattle. Although he still has the same red-haired look, he definitely doesn’t look like a member of the Partridge family anymore.</p><p>(image via&nbsp;https://twitter.com/chuckagautier)</p><p><strong>Ron Howard</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BhrlWcNCMAA-2sC.jpg alt=BhrlWcNCMAA-2sC width=640 height=511 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Ron Howard is quite possibly one of the most successful former child stars of all-time. Howard began his role as an uncredited actor in the 1956 film, Frontier Woman. Throughout the 50s and 60s, Howard’s career began to take off, most notably with his portrayal of Opie Taylor in The Andy Griffith Show. His red hair and cute smile made him extremely popular among fans, and even though he’s had a great&nbsp;career as an adult, many still see him the way he looked as a child.&nbsp;Although Howard doesn’t appear much in front of the camera these days, he’s found great success working as a director and producer.</p><p>(image via&nbsp;https://twitter.com/CHANNINGPOSTERS)</p><p><strong>Lark Voorhies</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CBgpsWqUwAAy92R.jpg alt=CBgpsWqUwAAy92R width=641 height=429 sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Best-known for her role as Lisa Turtle on the popular TV show, Saved By the Bell, many fans are stunned by Voorhies’ present appearances. &nbsp;On the show, her looks and fashion sense were a large part of her character, but recently her skin has appeared very blotchy and discolored. &nbsp;Some believe that she has been undergoing a skin lightening procedure commonly known as ‘bleaching’ while others believe she’s simply become prone to having make up mishaps. &nbsp;Either way, she definitely looks a lot different from she did during the height of her career.</p><p>(image via&nbsp;https://twitter.com/B_Ronnn)</p><p><strong>Taj Mowry</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BN7CIOqCMAE5zMX.jpg alt=BN7CIOqCMAE5zMX width=640 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As the younger brother of actresses Tia and Tamera Mowry, Taj Mowry was no stranger to the spotlight during his childhood. &nbsp;However, in 1997, he landed his own sitcom, Smart Guy, in which he played a wiz kid who attended high school with his older brother. &nbsp;Like most child stars, Mowry took a break from the spotlight for a couple of years before returning as an adult – and when he reappeared many were stunned at how different he looked. &nbsp;Now back in front of the camera, Mowry stars on the ABC Family sitcom, Baby Daddy.</p><p>(image via&nbsp;https://twitter.com/ako_mrdoodles)</p><p><strong>Macaulay Culkin</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/57126490.jpg alt width=641 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At the height of his career, Macaulay Culkin was the most popular child star on the scene. &nbsp;As the star of Home Alone, he instantly became a household name, and many had large predictions for the future of his career. However, familiar issues and disputes with his earnings caused Culkin to withdraw and ultimately retire from acting. &nbsp;Once known for his cute face, in recent years, Culkin has appeared to be very thin and almost unrecognizable from his days as a child star.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by David Livingston/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Jonathan Lipnicki</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CCgqYIVW4AA5NjE.png alt=CCgqYIVW4AA5NjE width=640 height=350 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As a child, Jonathan Lipnicki became well-known for his apperance in several popular films like Jerry Maguire, Stuart Little, and Like Mike.&nbsp;Viewers loved Lipnicki and his cute face and personality. &nbsp;However, now a 24 year-old mixed martial artist, Lipnicki has grown into a handsome young man who has definitely left his baby face in the past. &nbsp;Fans who see Lipnicki today will definitely have a hard time believing he’s the same person.</p><p>(image via&nbsp;https://twitter.com/portalfamososbr)</p><p><strong>Alyson Stoner</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/B9w_tccIUAAWfSy.jpg alt=B9w_tccIUAAWfSy width=640 height=320 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>If you grew up during the early 2000s, you probably know Alyson Stoner as Sally from Mike’s Super Short Show, or as the little backup dancer in Missy Elliot’s music videos. &nbsp;Earlier this year, Stoner released a dance tribute to Missy, and fans could not believe that she was the same little girl. &nbsp;With that being said, you’ve probably seen Stoner on-screen over the years, without even realizing who you were looking at.</p><p>(image via&nbsp;https://twitter.com/thekelsness)</p><p><strong>Jerry O’Connell</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/463830764.jpg alt="Premiere Of Logo TV's &#34;RuPaul's Drag Race&#34; Season 7 - Red Carpet" width=640 height=520 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>It’s hard to believe that Jerry O’Connell is the same chubby kid from the 1986 film, Stand by Me.&nbsp;Now a successful adult star, O’Connell grew out of the chubby cheeks. Unlike some other former child stars, O’Connell might actually be better known for his work as an adult.</p><p>(Getty Images)</p><p>lead&nbsp;(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWTnbatsIysq5qqo2K5sLvKZqquqqCntrS1zaCjsmWUnrOnsdGepa1lpKSxosWO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-child-stars-look-surprisingly-different-today.html&text=10%20Child%20Stars%20Who%20Look%20Surprisingly%20Different%20Today&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-child-stars-look-surprisingly-different-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-child-stars-look-surprisingly-different-today.html&title=10%20Child%20Stars%20Who%20Look%20Surprisingly%20Different%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-child-stars-look-surprisingly-different-today.html&title=10%20Child%20Stars%20Who%20Look%20Surprisingly%20Different%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-child-stars-look-surprisingly-different-today.html&title=10%20Child%20Stars%20Who%20Look%20Surprisingly%20Different%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-child-stars-look-surprisingly-different-today.html&description=10%20Child%20Stars%20Who%20Look%20Surprisingly%20Different%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10126851-chiefs-patrick-mahomes-celebrates-klay-thompsons-rumored-mavs-contract.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes Celebrates Klay Thompson's Rumored Mavs Contract | News, Scores, Highlights,">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-greyston-holt-wife-or-girlfriend-cristina-rosato-more-on-his-net-worth-and-married-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fraudster who blew 200,000 life insurance payout that his dead wife had left for her son on luxury">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
