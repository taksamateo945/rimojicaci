His full name is Dashiell Quinn Connery and he spent his formative years in California.</p><p>Dashiell comes from Irish, Scottish, English, and Italian heritage. The Italian part of the youngster’s roots came from his maternal grandparents, Jerome Sarapochiello and Diana. The English, Irish, and Scottish in his genetic mix are all part of his paternity. Dashiell’s paternal grandfather, Sean Connery, was one of the most famous Scottish actors to ever grace the movie world. His wife, Diane Cilento is English.</p><p>Dashiell may be the only child of his dad but he has one half-sister Amelia Jane Henson from his mother’s other relationship. The youngster hasn’t said anything about his academics but he is expected to have finished college in his mid-20s.</p><h2><strong>Who Are Dashiell Connery’s Parents?</strong></h2><p>Dashiell Connery’s parents are Jason Connery and Mia Sara. Born on January 11th, 1963, Jason is currently working in behind the scene roles as a director, however, he used to play the lead in the British series known as Robin of Sherwood. Jason Connery is the son of the legendary movie icon Sean Connery. This means that Sean Connery is the paternal grandfather of Dashiell.</p><p>Mia Sara on the other hand was born on June 1967. An American movie star, Mia gained popularity on the set of the comedy movie called Ferris Bueller’s Day Off in 1986. She still remains relevant in the movie world; her latest role was witnessed in the 2017 animation, Mowgli.</p><h3><strong>Dashiell’s Parents are Divorced but he Maintains Close Ties with Both of Them</strong></h3><p>Jason and Mia were already one year into their relationship when they welcomed their only child, Dashiell Connery. The duo met in 1995 while filming the movie, Bullet to Beijing and tied the nuptials a year later in 1996; Dashiell came in 1997.</p><p>When Dashiell’s parents got divorced in 2002, the up-and-coming movie star got to live with his mother. His dad has remained single to date and is currently helping him in pursuing a movie career.</p><p>However, the story is different for Mia as she fell in love shortly after her divorce from Jason. She became the girlfriend of American technician, puppeteer, producer, and director, Brian Henson, around the early 2000s. They welcomed the only child of their union Amelia Jane Henson in 2005; five years later in 2010, the couple went to tie the knot. Their union has lasted a decade and still counting.</p><p>Dashiell has a good relationship with both of his parents. He once described his dad as the most wonderful person he knows and on his own part, Jason took the decision to relocate to LA just to be close to Dashiell. The upcoming thespian has also described his mum as “The best mother I could ever have asked for.”</p><h2><strong>Does Dashiell have a Relationship with his Grandfather?</strong></h2><p>Dashiell Connery had a great relationship with his grandfather, the late Sean Connery. In fact, the youngster is a spitting image of Sean and the two were inseparable during the latter’s lifetime. According to the late legendary movie powerhouse, he always enjoys playing football with Dashiell and they are one of his most cherished moments.&nbsp; The feeling is obviously reciprocated by Dashiell who took to his social media to mourn the movie icon immediately after his passing</p><h2><strong>What Does Dashiell Connery Do?</strong></h2><p>Dashiell Connery is an actor. He followed in the footsteps of his dad and his grandfather and debuted in the 2009 movie Pandemic at the age of 12.</p><p>Following his debut, Dashiell disappeared from the screen until 11 years later in 2018 when he made a comeback on the set of the 2018 music video, Twenty-One Pilots: My Blood as himself. His next onscreen role was also a music video entitled, Sam Hunt: Young Once in 2020 as a young man</p><p>Dashiell joined the cast of The Rookie in 2021 as Angus Nettle. The year 2021 proved to be quite prolific for Dashiell Connery. He made an appearance in the movie, Ted Bundy: American Boogeyman as Bobby Kelske, played Jason Quinn in one episode of NCIS: Los Angeles, and was part of the cast of Outcry as Billy.</p><p>2022 opened with Sean Connery’s grandson playing Daeg in Challenger. He also played the same role in Bury Me before the end of the year. No doubt, he played the highest number of roles in 2022 appearing in Casual Vignettes of Gilded Vulgarity as Felix Splendor, in one episode of The series, Animal Kingdom, as Kai, and in seven episodes of Tulsa King where he played Clint; the role spanned from 2022 to 2023.</p><p>Though his acting career is still in its teething stage, Dashiell has shown that he inherited the gene that runs in his family and there are signs that he may well become a formidable force in the industry. With his stellar pedigree, Dashiell is expected to surpass his parents’ and grandparents’ records and from the looks of things, the youngster is moving in the right direction. However, it will take some time for him to surpass the groundbreaking history left by his grandfather, the legendary Sean Connery.</p><p>Dashiell who is passionate about acting has said that he scores roles as a result of his great acting talent and not because of his last name. However, he also admitted that getting his family’s support has been an added booster to the success he has seen so far. Below is a comprehensive list of his productions.</p><h4><strong>Dashiell Connery’s Filmography</strong></h4><ul><li>Tulsa King (TV series) as Clint 2022</li><li>Animal Kingdom (TV series) as Kai – 2022</li><li>Casual Vignettes of Gilded Vulgarity as Felix Splendor – 2022</li><li>Clowning ass Tic Tac – 2022</li><li>Bury Me as Daeg – 2022</li><li>Challenger as Daeg – 2022</li><li>Outcry as Billy – 2021</li><li>NCIS: Los Angeles (TV series) as Jason Quinn – 2021</li><li>Ted Bundy: American Boogeyman as Bobby Kelske – 2021</li><li>The Rookie (TV series) as Angus Nettle in 2021</li><li>Sam Hunt: Young Once (music video) as Young Man – 2020</li><li>Twenty-One Pilots: My Blood (music video) as Dashiell Connery – 2018</li><li>Pandemic as Kid -2009</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmm5qrmJ6yrbiMnKanppWnxm6%2FxJqlZpufo7umvtisZKCqkaOxtLvNaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-dashiell-connery-sean-connerys-grandson.html&text=Meet%20Dashiell%20Connery%20-%20Sean%20Connery%27s%20Grandson&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-dashiell-connery-sean-connerys-grandson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-dashiell-connery-sean-connerys-grandson.html&title=Meet%20Dashiell%20Connery%20-%20Sean%20Connery%27s%20Grandson" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-dashiell-connery-sean-connerys-grandson.html&title=Meet%20Dashiell%20Connery%20-%20Sean%20Connery%27s%20Grandson" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-dashiell-connery-sean-connerys-grandson.html&title=Meet%20Dashiell%20Connery%20-%20Sean%20Connery%27s%20Grandson" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-dashiell-connery-sean-connerys-grandson.html&description=Meet%20Dashiell%20Connery%20-%20Sean%20Connery%27s%20Grandson" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-truth-about-hyper-realistic-video-games-as-war-simulators.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The truth about 'hyper-realistic' video games as war simulators">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./79415-unpacking-debate-coloured-culture-democratic-south-africa-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Unpacking the debate on Coloured Culture in democratic South Africa">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
