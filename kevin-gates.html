He also caught the attention of Lil Wayne’s record label, Young Money Entertainment. Gates was signed to the management wing of the label later that year. Although he was signed to the management wing, Gates never signed a record deal with Young Money. He noted, however, that it was Birdman who gave him the idea to start his own record label later on.</p><h2>Kevin Gates Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Kevin Gates is one of the <strong>richest Rapper</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Kevin Gates</b>'s net worth <strong>$1 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He started recording his first songs in 2007, at age 19.</p><p align=justify>His debut studio album, Stranger Than Fiction, reached #37 on the Billboard 200.</p><p align=justify>Kevin Jerome Gilyard was born on February 5, 1986, to a Puerto Rican mother and an African American father. He and his family relocated to Baton Rouge soon after his birth. Gates had an often tumultuous upbringing and was arrested for the first time in 1999 at the age of 13 for “joyriding” as a passenger. He lost contact with his father at a young age, but later reconnected with him as a teenager. His father died of complications from AIDS when Gates was 14 years old. When he was 17, he briefly attended Baton Rouge Community College. Gates is of Moroccan and Puerto Rican descent.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In early 2013, Gates released the mixtape, The Luca Brasi Story, via his Bread Winners’ Association record label. The mixtape received critical praise with Pitchfork saying it, “imbues trap’s claustrophobic bleakness with an emotional nakedness, capable lyricism, and melodic certitude many of its recent breakout stars have lacked.” Rolling Stone named the mixtape’s single, “Wylin’ “, the 40th best song of 2013. On the heels of the success of that mixtape, Gates was signed to Atlantic Records. He released his first major label mixtape, Stranger Than Fiction, in July 2013. The mixtape deals with issues ranging from depression to Gates’ time in prison. The mixtape also received favorable reviews despite generally being shorter than Gates had originally hoped. Stranger Than Fiction also marked the first time one of Gates’ mixtapes charted on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 37.</p><p>Gates’ first arrest occurred when he was 13 for being a passenger in a stolen vehicle. Gates was briefly jailed for the offense, and said that being jailed had a profound effect on his life: “If they would’ve just pulled up to the jail, left me in the police car, never took me inside and just took me back home, I don’t think I’d ever have done anything else again. But what it did was—by me going into jail at such a young age—all it did was criminalize me in a sense. It kinda steered me in the wrong direction after getting there and settling in; it took the fear of jail away from me.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kevin Gates height</b> Not available right now.

Another mixtape, All or Nuthin’ , was released in 2008 and featured what Gates described as “a lot of pain…a lot of true stories.” In 2008, both Gates and Boosie were incarcerated in separate cases, effectively pausing Gates’ music career. He spent 31 months in prison between 2008 and 2011. During this time, Gates claimed he earned a master’s degree in psychology through a prison program.
