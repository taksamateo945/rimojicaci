It’s a time when you’re trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do with your life. And what better way to get through this important decade than by watching some great movies?</p><p>Movies can take us to new places, teach us important lessons, and motivate us to be our best selves. You’ll probably have a wide range of experiences and feelings in your twenties, and these movies can help you make sense of it all.</p><p>But what is it about a movie that makes it perfect for your twenties? So, it’s all about being real. In this decade, the movies that speak to us most are the ones that reflect our own lives, problems, and hopes. They show what it’s like to be young and unsure, and they also make us want to dream big and follow our passions.</p><p>Whether you’re trying to figure out love and relationships, your place in the world, or just who you are, these movies can help. They give us comfort, wisdom, and ideas, and they remind us that we are not alone on our journey.</p><p>No one’s twenties are exactly the same, so this list of movies is by no means complete. But it’s a place to start, a collection of movies that a lot of twentysomethings have liked over the years. Some are old favourites, while others are newer, but they all have one thing in common: they capture the spirit of youth and the beauty of not knowing.</p><p>So, if you want a story that will <a href=#>make you cry</a>, make you laugh out loud, or make you feel good about growing up, this list has you covered. These movies will change the way you think about love, friendship, family, work, and everything else. They’ll make you want to dream big and follow your passions, and they’ll also remind you that it’s okay to stumble and make mistakes along the way.</p><p>So get comfortable and let these movies show you how to live through one of the most exciting and life-changing decades of your life.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> 20th Century Women (2016)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Amélie (2001)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Before Sunrise (1995)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Begin Again (2013)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Black Swan (2010)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Bo Burnham: Inside (2021)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Columbus (2017)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Dear Zindagi (2016)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (2004)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Frances Ha (2012)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">11</span> In The Mood For Love (2000)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">12</span> Lady Bird (2017)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">13</span> Licorice Pizza (2021)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">14</span> Marriage Story (2019)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">15</span> Mistress America (2015)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">16</span> Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">17</span> On The Beach At Night Alone (2017)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">18</span> Parasite (2019)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">19</span> Portrait Of A Lady On Fire (2019)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">20</span> Reality Bites (1994)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">21</span> Shiva Baby (2020)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">22</span> Short Term 12 (2013)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">23</span> Take This Waltz (2011)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">24</span> The Devil Wears Prada (2006)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">25</span> The Father (2020)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">26</span> The Florida Project (2017)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">27</span> The Lobster (2015)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">28</span> The Social Network (2010)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">29</span> The Worst Person In The World (2021)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">30</span> Unicorn Store (2017)</a></li></ul><h3><span id=20th_Century_Women_2016>20th Century Women (2016)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20th-Century-Women-1.jpg alt="movies for 21 year olds on netflix,movies every girl in her 20s should see,films about being in your 20s,movies about dating in your 20s,movies to watch in your 20s reddit,movies for 21 year olds,movies about late 20s,movies about being lost in your 20s,movies for 25 year olds,movies for 20 year olds on netflix,movies to watch in your 20s,romance movies to watch in your 20s,netflix movies to watch in your 20s,movies to watch in your late 20s,movies to watch in your early 20s,movies to watch when you turn 20,good movies to watch for 20 year olds,21 movies to watch,movies to watch for 20 year olds,movies every 20 year old should watch" width=570 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>20th Century Women is a beautiful and touching movie about motherhood, friendship, and growing up.

Amélie is a shy and creative young woman who decides to help the people around her. This is the story of the movie. Along the way, she falls in love with Nino, a young man with a similar sense of humour to hers. The movie is a celebration of life’s small pleasures, and Amélie’s charm makes it impossible not to fall in love with her. The movie is beautiful to look at. It has bright colours and a fun soundtrack. This movie is based on the idea that life is full of magic and wonder, and that sometimes all it takes to make the world a better place is a little bit of imagination.</p><h3><span id=Before_Sunrise_1995>Before Sunrise (1995)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Before-Sunrise.jpg alt="movies for 21 year olds on netflix,movies every girl in her 20s should see,films about being in your 20s,movies about dating in your 20s,movies to watch in your 20s reddit,movies for 21 year olds,movies about late 20s,movies about being lost in your 20s,movies for 25 year olds,movies for 20 year olds on netflix,movies to watch in your 20s,romance movies to watch in your 20s,netflix movies to watch in your 20s,movies to watch in your late 20s,movies to watch in your early 20s,movies to watch when you turn 20,good movies to watch for 20 year olds,21 movies to watch,movies to watch for 20 year olds,movies every 20 year old should watch" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Before Sunrise is a love story that takes place in Vienna over one night. The movie is about an American traveller named Jesse and a French student named Celine. They meet on a train and decide to spend the night in Vienna together. They walk around the city and talk about life, love, and everything in between. Over the course of the night, they get to know each other very well. The movie is beautifully shot, and <a href=#>Ethan Hawke</a> and Julie Delpy have electric chemistry on screen. This movie shows that sometimes the most meaningful connections can happen in the most unexpected places, and that true love is about more than just physical attraction.</p><h3><span id=Begin_Again_2013>Begin Again (2013)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/b1.jpg alt="movies for 21 year olds on netflix,movies every girl in her 20s should see,films about being in your 20s,movies about dating in your 20s,movies to watch in your 20s reddit,movies for 21 year olds,movies about late 20s,movies about being lost in your 20s,movies for 25 year olds,movies for 20 year olds on netflix,movies to watch in your 20s,romance movies to watch in your 20s,netflix movies to watch in your 20s,movies to watch in your late 20s,movies to watch in your early 20s,movies to watch when you turn 20,good movies to watch for 20 year olds,21 movies to watch,movies to watch for 20 year olds,movies every 20 year old should watch" width=648 height=365 sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Begin Again is a touching movie about two people who have lost their way and find each other through music.

Natalie Portman plays a ballerina who gets the lead role in “Swan Lake.” As she plays the Black Swan more and more, she starts to lose touch with reality. The movie looks at things like trying to be perfect, <a href=#>mental health</a>, and trying to be the best no matter what.</p><p>Black Swan is a movie that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. It has amazing dance scenes, haunting images, and a powerful performance by Natalie Portman. It’s a reminder that trying to be the best can be expensive and that the line between reality and delusion can be dangerously thin at times.</p><h3><span id=Bo_Burnham_Inside_2021>Bo Burnham: Inside (2021)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/movieweb-1200-630-2023-02-27t003310-517.jpg alt="movies for 21 year olds on netflix,movies every girl in her 20s should see,films about being in your 20s,movies about dating in your 20s,movies to watch in your 20s reddit,movies for 21 year olds,movies about late 20s,movies about being lost in your 20s,movies for 25 year olds,movies for 20 year olds on netflix,movies to watch in your 20s,romance movies to watch in your 20s,netflix movies to watch in your 20s,movies to watch in your late 20s,movies to watch in your early 20s,movies to watch when you turn 20,good movies to watch for 20 year olds,21 movies to watch,movies to watch for 20 year olds,movies every 20 year old should watch" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, comedian Bo Burnham wrote, directed, and performed a one-man show called Bo Burnham: Inside. The movie is a musical comedy about being alone, being creative, and feeling lonely. The <a href=#>songs</a> are funny and sad at the same time, and the visual effects are beautiful. The plot is a reflection on what it was like to be a performer when live shows were impossible and how being alone can hurt our mental health. Most of the movie is about how art can bring comfort, connection, and hope during hard times. It’s a funny and touching look at what people went through during the pandemic.</p><h3><span id=Columbus_2017>Columbus (2017)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hayley-lu-richardson-and-john-cho-in-columbus.jpg alt="movies for 21 year olds on netflix,movies every girl in her 20s should see,films about being in your 20s,movies about dating in your 20s,movies to watch in your 20s reddit,movies for 21 year olds,movies about late 20s,movies about being lost in your 20s,movies for 25 year olds,movies for 20 year olds on netflix,movies to watch in your 20s,romance movies to watch in your 20s,netflix movies to watch in your 20s,movies to watch in your late 20s,movies to watch in your early 20s,movies to watch when you turn 20,good movies to watch for 20 year olds,21 movies to watch,movies to watch for 20 year olds,movies every 20 year old should watch" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Columbus is a beautiful and moving movie that looks at how architecture and the human experience are connected. The movie is about a young woman who stays in Columbus, Indiana to take care of her mother and a Korean-born man who comes to the city to take care of his estranged architect father.

The story doesn’t go in a straight line, which adds to the feeling of being lost and confused. Olivia Colman plays his daughter, who is trying to care for and help him but also has her own problems to deal with.</p><p>The movie is a strong reminder of how fragile the mind is and how ageing can hurt our bodies and minds. The main thing to take away is a deep sense of compassion for people with memory loss and the people who care for them. It shows how complicated the relationship between parents and children can be as they face the challenges of getting older.</p><h3><span id=The_Florida_Project_2017>The Florida Project (2017)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Florida-Project-1.jpg alt="movies for 21 year olds on netflix,movies every girl in her 20s should see,films about being in your 20s,movies about dating in your 20s,movies to watch in your 20s reddit,movies for 21 year olds,movies about late 20s,movies about being lost in your 20s,movies for 25 year olds,movies for 20 year olds on netflix,movies to watch in your 20s,romance movies to watch in your 20s,netflix movies to watch in your 20s,movies to watch in your late 20s,movies to watch in your early 20s,movies to watch when you turn 20,good movies to watch for 20 year olds,21 movies to watch,movies to watch for 20 year olds,movies every 20 year old should watch" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Florida Project is a heartwarming and heartbreaking coming-of-age story about a smart 6-year-old girl and her single mother who get into trouble near Disney World. The movie shows how colourful and real the lives of poor people in a state where dreams and magic are said to happen are. The child actor’s amazing performance and the comments on the harsh truths of life will make you question the idea of the American dream.</p><h3><span id=The_Lobster_2015>The Lobster (2015)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Lobster-1.jpg alt="movies for 21 year olds on netflix,movies every girl in her 20s should see,films about being in your 20s,movies about dating in your 20s,movies to watch in your 20s reddit,movies for 21 year olds,movies about late 20s,movies about being lost in your 20s,movies for 25 year olds,movies for 20 year olds on netflix,movies to watch in your 20s,romance movies to watch in your 20s,netflix movies to watch in your 20s,movies to watch in your late 20s,movies to watch in your early 20s,movies to watch when you turn 20,good movies to watch for 20 year olds,21 movies to watch,movies to watch for 20 year olds,movies every 20 year old should watch" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Are you sick of all the stress that comes with dating and looking for love? Then you should watch The Lobster. In this strange black comedy, single people have 45 days to find a partner or they will turn into an animal of their choice. The movie shows David, who is played by Colin Farrell, making his way through this strange world and its strange rules.</p><p>The movie The Lobster stands out because of how strange and funny it is. It takes a satirical look at how people are often forced to live up to society’s expectations about love and relationships. The characters are strange and complicated, and the movie makes you think a lot about love and being yourself.</p><h3><span id=The_Social_Network_2010>The Social Network (2010)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sony-pictures-releasing-1.jpg alt="movies for 21 year olds on netflix,movies every girl in her 20s should see,films about being in your 20s,movies about dating in your 20s,movies to watch in your 20s reddit,movies for 21 year olds,movies about late 20s,movies about being lost in your 20s,movies for 25 year olds,movies for 20 year olds on netflix,movies to watch in your 20s,romance movies to watch in your 20s,netflix movies to watch in your 20s,movies to watch in your late 20s,movies to watch in your early 20s,movies to watch when you turn 20,good movies to watch for 20 year olds,21 movies to watch,movies to watch for 20 year olds,movies every 20 year old should watch" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Facebook has changed the way we talk and connect with each other, whether we like it or not. The Social Network is an exciting drama about how Facebook came to be and about the people who made it happen. Mark Zuckerberg, a smart but awkward programmer, is played by Jesse Eisenberg. His best friend and co-founder, Eduardo Saverin, is played by Andrew Garfield. Saverin is pushed out of the company.</p><p>The movie looks at friendship, ambition, and betrayal, and it also asks important questions about how technology is changing our society. The Social Network is a must-see for anyone interested in how technology, business, and culture interact. The story moves quickly, the actors are great, and the music is great.</p><h3><span id=The_Worst_Person_In_The_World_2021>The Worst Person In The World (2021)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-worst-person-in-the-world-2-1200x630-2.jpg alt="movies for 21 year olds on netflix,movies every girl in her 20s should see,films about being in your 20s,movies about dating in your 20s,movies to watch in your 20s reddit,movies for 21 year olds,movies about late 20s,movies about being lost in your 20s,movies for 25 year olds,movies for 20 year olds on netflix,movies to watch in your 20s,romance movies to watch in your 20s,netflix movies to watch in your 20s,movies to watch in your late 20s,movies to watch in your early 20s,movies to watch when you turn 20,good movies to watch for 20 year olds,21 movies to watch,movies to watch for 20 year olds,movies every 20 year old should watch" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This Norwegian movie is about a young woman named Julie and her relationships, career, and personal growth over the course of several years.
