"Upon arriving for dinner, fans quickly spotted the acclaimed pop star and whipped out their phones to snap photos and film her, causing Spears to become visibly upset, footage obtained by the outlet shows. According to witnesses, the seemingly 'manic' 41-year-old 'Piece of Me' singer began yelling and 'talking gibberish,' prompting Asghari to storm out of the Woodland Hills restaurant, TMZ reported."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/britney-spears-1.jpg><p><span>On Sunday, Spears responded to the accusation and posted an illustration of a girl pouring syrup on pancakes and captioned it: "I watched 'NATURAL BORN KILLERS' this morning and â€¦ I got ENLIGHTENED â€¦ and HOLY SMOKES â€¦ I'm sure I brought a billion SMILES to me LOOKING LIKE SHREK at a restaurant. Even my best friend couldn't WAIT TO SEND IT TO ME, THEY DON'T THINK TWICE because we are all natural born killers â€¦ I know the news is all hyped about me being a little drunk at a restaurant â€¦ it's like they'll be WATCHING MY EVERY MOVE ðŸ‘€ !!! I'm so flattered they talk about me like a maniac THEN â€¦ talk about all the negative things that happened in my past !!! Honestly it would be safer for me to compliment this world and [mess up] because if I become a prophet and don't create history, we might have something y'allâ€¦ I'm just KIDDING, but it's a good thought." She continued: "I know y'all are rooting for me and all and make sure you check out the shocking Shrek picture of me â€¦ I was like â€¦ that's horrific yet there were two pics where I was normal." She added a hmm emoji. "Either way honestly I know nobody [cares] what I do !!!

Asghari is a personal trainer and model, who is best known for his relationship with Spears. The couple met on the set of a music video for Spears' song "Slumber Party" in 2016 and have been together since. Sam is also known for his appearances on various fitness and health-related programs and publications.</span><span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/shutterstock_1459319312.jpg><p><span>Spears has had a tumultuous relationship with the press throughout her career. From her early days as a teenage sensation to her highly publicized personal struggles, the media has been both a supporter and a critic of the artist. </span><span>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Britney was hailed as the "Princess of Pop" and was often portrayed in a positive light by the media. Her highly choreographed music videos and catchy pop songs made her a household name and earned her a dedicated fanbase.</span></p><p><span>However, as Britney's personal life began to unravel in the mid-2000s, the media's coverage of her took a darker turn. Her highly publicized marriage and subsequent divorce from Kevin Federline, as well as her struggles with mental health and substance abuse, were heavily covered by the tabloids and gossip magazines.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/britney-spears.jpg><p><span>Many critics have accused the press of exploiting Britney's personal struggles for their own gain, with some claiming that the constant media attention contributed to her downward spiral. Others argue that the press was simply reporting on events that were already publicly known and that Britney was a willing participant in her own publicity. </span><span>Regardless of one's stance on the media's coverage of Britney, it is clear that the artist has been deeply affected by her relationship with the press.</span></p><p><span>In recent years, Britney has taken steps to regain control of her narrative, including launching her own social media accounts and giving rare interviews in which she speaks candidly about her life and career. </span><span>Despite the challenges she has faced, Britney continues to be a beloved and influential figure in the world of pop music. Her influence can be seen in the many young artists who have cited her as a major influence and inspiration. As fans continue to support and advocate for the pop star, it's clear that her legacy will continue to be felt for many years to come.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmp52nqHqjvsitpZ6xXai9pq3RrGSrnaOlvK%2Bw0marqGWdmrm1sM6wpWaZk5jCtK3Toqanq18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnews-britney-spears-responds-to-meltdown-accusations.html&text=Britney%20Spears%20Responds%20to%20Restaurant%20%26quot%3bMeltdown%26quot%3b%20Accusations&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnews-britney-spears-responds-to-meltdown-accusations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnews-britney-spears-responds-to-meltdown-accusations.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20Responds%20to%20Restaurant%20%26quot%3bMeltdown%26quot%3b%20Accusations" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnews-britney-spears-responds-to-meltdown-accusations.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20Responds%20to%20Restaurant%20%26quot%3bMeltdown%26quot%3b%20Accusations" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnews-britney-spears-responds-to-meltdown-accusations.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20Responds%20to%20Restaurant%20%26quot%3bMeltdown%26quot%3b%20Accusations" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnews-britney-spears-responds-to-meltdown-accusations.html&description=Britney%20Spears%20Responds%20to%20Restaurant%20%26quot%3bMeltdown%26quot%3b%20Accusations" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-carolla-show-comedy-podcast-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The ___ Carolla Show (comedy podcast)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./al-pacino-on-his-upcoming-75th-birthday-age-is-just-a-number-55633.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Al Pacino on His Upcoming 75th Birthday: Age is Just a Number">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
