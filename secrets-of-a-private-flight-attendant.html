The line-up went something like this: sexy black secretary-style suit comprising a pencil skirt and jacket, nipped and tucked and ending mid-hip; tailored black trousers; a classic fitted black dress; virgin wool charcoal pea coat with fur trim detail; four cream blouses – sheer, but not completely see-through; a cardigan; Hermès silk neck scarves; couple of skinny leather belts – both Prada; a handbag, also Prada; footwear by Salvatore Ferragamo – a pair of heels and knee-high boots for on the ground, and two pairs of ballet pumps to wear in the air.
