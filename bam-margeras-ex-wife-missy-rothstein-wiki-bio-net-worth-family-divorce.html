In addition to his stunts, acting and other endeavors in the entertainment industry, he is also a successful skateboarder. His popularity has expanded to people around him, including his ex-wife, Missy Rothstein. She is an actress, model, reality TV star, and photographer, but came to prominence through her marriage to Bam Margera, which lasted from 2007 until 2012.</p><p>So, do you want to find out more about Bam Margera’s ex-wife, from her childhood to most recent career endeavors and her personal life as well? If yes, then stay with us for a while, as we bring you closer to Missy Rothstein.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/missy-rothstein-2.jpg><h2><span id=Missy_Rothstein_Wiki_Age_Childhood_and_Education><strong>Missy Rothstein Wiki: Age, Childhood, and Education</strong></span></h2><p>Born Melissa Rothstein on the 3rd June 1980, in Springfield, Pennsylvania USA, she was raised by a single mother, Marian Rothstein – information about her father remains unknown for now. In regards to her education, Missy went to Chester High School, where she met Bam for the first time, but they were nothing more than friends. Following her matriculation, Missy enrolled at Pennsylvania State University, from which she obtained a bachelor’s degree in Communication.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></span></h2><p>At a young age, Missy had already aspired to become a model; however, without a proper chance, she quickly dropped her dreams and delved into acting and reality television. Her first acting experience was in the film “Haggard”, directed by her future husband, Bam Margera, and starring Margera himself, Ryan Dunn and Brandon DiCamillo. However, since then, Missy has only one more acting credit, as Hot Nurse in the film “Minghags” in 2009, which was directed by Bam Margera and Brandon DiCamillo.</p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Stardom><strong>Rise to Stardom</strong></span></h2><p>Melissa and Bam met again in the mid- 2000s, and he helped her acquire a few acting engagements, during which they started a romantic relationship. Once their relationship became public knowledge, everyone wanted to know everything about Bam’s new girlfriend. However, she has managed to hide almost all the important details about her life. Nevertheless, the two launched the reality TV series about their life together, just before their marriage, entitled “Bam’s Unholy Union”, which lasted from 2006 to 2007. She and Bam continued to work together, and Missy secured several other appearances, including in “Bam Margera Presents: Where the #$&% Is Santa?” in 2008, starring Bam, Brandon Novak, Mark The Bagger and other stars. The film’s theme was celebrating Christmas and finding Santa Claus in the comedic style of Bam Margera.</p><p>Furthermore, Missy posed nude for Playboy, with Bam as a guest photographer; at first, she was against this, but after some convincing with Bam, she accepted the offer, which certainly made her even more popular with the public.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_with_Bam_Wedding_Divorce><strong>Relationship with Bam, Wedding, Divorce</strong></span></h2><p>The two have known each other since their high school years; they rekindled their relationship in the mid- 2000s and started dating. The two married on the 3rd February 2007, in a ceremony held at the Loews Hotel in downtown Philadelphia, with many celebrities in attendance, such as Ryan Dunn, who passed away in 2011. The couple enjoyed their romance until 2010 when problems started brewing between them. They started living not in different houses, but in different cities, and Bam was having affairs with not one, but two women. Their <a rel=nofollow href=#>marriage was officially over</a> on the 1st November 2012.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span id=Missy_Rothstein_Net_Worth><strong>Missy Rothstein Net Worth</strong></span></h2><p>Bam helped her greatly in establishing her career, and with their relationship and later marriage, Missy became quite popular. This newfound glory only increased her wealth, so have you ever wondered how rich Missy Rothstein is, as of early 2019? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Rothstein’s net worth is as high as $1 million, which is quite impressive, don’t you think? Undoubtedly, her net worth will become even higher in the upcoming years, assuming she continues her career.</p><h2><span id=Life_After_Divorce><strong>Life After Divorce</strong></span></h2><p>Missy’s life after 2012 has been a complete secret to the public. There is no information about where she now lives, and what she does for a living. She has retreated into complete obscurity and not simple news has come out about Missy. Hopefully, she emerges into the limelight in the future as her fans are eager to find out what is happening in her life.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bam rocking some of the latest BamMerch rings hot off the 3D printer ?? <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/w4jn6yUqVz</a></p><p>— Bam Margera Merch (@bam_merch) <a rel=nofollow href=#>February 7, 2019</a></p><h2><span id=Missy_Rothstein_Ex-Husband_Bam_Margera><strong>Missy Rothstein Ex-Husband, Bam Margera</strong></span></h2><p>Now that we have shared all there is about Missy, let’s share some information about Bam Margera.</p><p>Born as Brandon Cole Margera on the 28th September 1979, in West Chester, Pennsylvania USA, he is a skateboarder, stuntmen, actor, musician and so much more, best known to the world for his work with stunt crew and actors, known as Jackass.
